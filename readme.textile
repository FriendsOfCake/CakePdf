h1. CakePdf plugin

Plugin containing CakePdf lib which will use a pdf engine to convert html to pdf.

Current engines:
* DomPdf
* Mpdf
* Wkhtmltopdf (requires additional installation)

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.2.8
* CakePHP 2.x
* wkhtmltopdf (optional) See: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
* wkhtmltopdf (optional) See: http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/ceeram/CakePdf/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/Plugin
# Rename the folder you just copied to CakePdf

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/ceeram/CakePdf.git Plugin/CakePdf
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/ceeram/CakePdf.git CakePdf</code></pre>

h2. Setup

In app/Config/bootstrap.php add:
<pre><code>CakePlugin::load('CakePdf', array('bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true));
</code></pre>


h2. Configuration

Use <code>Configure::write('Pdf', $config);</code> or set Controller property <code>$pdfConfig</code> (only when used with PdfView)
You need to define at least <code>$config['engine']</code>. When using CakePdf directly you can also pass the config array to constructor.

h2. Usage

You can use CakePdf lib to create raw pdf data with a view template. The view file path would look like <code>app/View/Pdf/example.ctp</code>.
Layout file path would be like <code>app/View/Layouts/pdf/default.ctp</code>
Optionally you can also write the raw data to file, for instance to use as email attachment.

Also you can create pdf view and layout files for your controller actions and have them automatically.
Place the view templates in a 'pdf' subdir, for instance <code>app/View/Invoices/pdf/view.ctp</code>
Layouts will be in same location as in above example.

Make sure your InvoicesController has RequestHandler Component in the <code>$components</code> array.
Browse to http://localhost/invoices/view/1.pdf

h2. Encryption

You can optionally encrypt the PDF with permissions

To use encryption you first need to select a crypto engine. Currently we support the following crypto engines:

 * Pdftk

h3. Usage

Add the following in your bootstrap.

Configure::write('Pdf.crypto', 'CakePdf.Pdftk');

Options in pdfConfig:

 * protect: Set to true to enable encryption
 * userPassword (optional): Set a password to open the PDF file
 * ownerPassword (optional): Set the password to unlock the locked permissions
 * permissions (optional): Define the permissions

Permissions:

By default, we deny all permissions.

To allow all permissions:

Set 'permission' to true

To allow specific permissions:

Set 'permissions' to an array with a combination of the following available permissions:

 * print
 * degraded_print
 * modify,
 * assembly,
 * copy_contents,
 * screen_readers,
 * annotate,
 * fill_in
